    giving written notice to the other party if the other party:
       a) is in material breach of an obligation under the Agreement, which breach, if
          capable of remedy, has not been remedied within 30 days after such party has
          served written notice on the other party specifying the breach and the steps

    Agreement expressed to survive such termination.
68. On termination of the Agreement for any reason:
    a) all licences granted under the Agreement shall immediately terminate;

       the Client of the then most recent back-up of the Data. CarePlanner shall use
       reasonable commercial endeavours to deliver the back-up to the Client within 30
       days of its receipt of such a written request, provided that the Client has, at that
       time, paid all fees and charges outstanding at and resulting from termination
       (whether or not due at the date of termination). The Client shall pay all
       reasonable expenses incurred by CarePlanner in returning or disposing of Data;
       and
    d) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up
       to the date of termination, including the right to claim damages in respect of any

## OTHER GENERAL TERMS

## Entire Agreement

70. The Agreement with CarePlanner supersedes any previous agreements between the
    parties in relation to the matters dealt with in the Agreement and represents the
    entire understanding between the parties in relation to the subject matter they cover
    and each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that it has not entered into the
    Agreement in reliance upon any representation, warranty, undertaking, agreement,
    or statement (whether oral or written) made or alleged to have been made by any
    other party (whether or not negligently made) on or prior to the date of the
    Agreement except as expressly set out in the Agreement (provided that nothing
    contained in the Agreement shall operate to exclude any liability for fraudulent
    misrepresentation).
71. These Terms are subject to any express provision of the Commercial Terms or the
    Agreement. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Commercial
    Terms and any other express provision of the Agreement, the Commercial Terms shall
    prevail.

**Rights, Remedies and Powers**

72. A failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, remedy or power provided under
    the Agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the right, remedy or power or
    a waiver of any other right, remedy or power. No single or partial exercise of any right,
    remedy or power prevents any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right,
    remedy or power.
73. The rights, remedies and powers provided by the Agreement are cumulative and not
    exclusive of any rights, remedies or powers provided by law. Any waiver of a breach of
    any of the terms of the Agreement or of any default under the Agreement shall not be
    deemed a waiver of any other breach or default and shall not affect the other
    Agreement terms.

**Severance**

74. If any term or provision in the Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any
    extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law that term or
    provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of the Agreement
    and the enforceability of the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected.

**Assignment**

75. The Client may not assign or transfer any rights or liabilities under the Agreement to
    any other person without CarePlanner's prior written consent.
76. The Agreement shall be binding and shall endure for the benefit of the successors in
    title of each party.

**Notices**

77. Any notice given under the terms of the Agreement by either party to the other must
    be in writing by email and will be deemed to have been given on transmission. Notices
    to CarePlanner must be sent to enquires@care-planner.co.uk or to any other email
    address notified by email to Clients by CarePlanner. Notices to Clients will be sent to
    the email address which Clients provide when setting up their access to the Service

    relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any decision. Although CarePlanner
