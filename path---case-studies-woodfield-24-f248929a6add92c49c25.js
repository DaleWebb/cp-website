Currently, 18 staff members deliver 400 hours of care each week for people approaching the final stages of life, and plans are in place for the operation to double in size.\n\nIn her position as Registered Manager, Jo researched several rota systems for domiciliary care, but was attracted to CarePlanner for its simplicity.\n\nShe states: “The pricing is very straightforward; it’s an all-in-one solution, whereas other systems advertise one price for the basic module, and then want additional fees for additional features.”\n",problem:"The nature of Woodfield24’s service means they have a high turnover of service users, as individual circumstances can change rapidly. As such, it’s vital that the rota is easy to edit and update. Jo comments: “Scheduling appointments is actually very straightforward, but the rota often looks completely different from the morning to the end of the day.\n\n“We constantly have new referrals, whilst other patients pass away or need to increase their number of visits at very short notice. Frankly, I don’t know how we’d cope without CarePlanner because it makes the admin side of things so easy.”\n\nAs an NHS-funded service, Jo also has to run reports on several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) each month, such as the time spent providing face-to-face care and time spent travelling between visits. These can be generated with a few simple clicks, and exported into Excel spreadsheets.\n",solution:"CarePlanner’s secure cloud-based system ensures that rota changes are automatically updated and immediately viewable. Woodfield24 staff are also provided with Android phones and use the CarePlanner app to check-in at each location, keep on top of messages and share information.\n\n“If there are three or four different people involved in one person’s care, it’s really useful to leave notes and communicate with each other in the online diary. This has proven to be extremely helpful in ensuring we deliver the very best service.”\n\nJo also uses the CarePlanner dashboard to send and receive text messages, communicating urgent updates to staff and notifying them of last minute changes.\n",results:"The most important KPI in Jo’s eyes is the percentage of people that die where they wish to. Nationally, this figure stands at 50%, but Woodfield24 delivers a 95% success rate. “We’re very proud of this,” confirms Jo, “and CarePlanner has helped us achieve it.”\n\nThe CarePlanner team are always accessible, checking in on helpdesk enquiries seven days a week. Jo continues: “They respond to calls and emails very quickly, and have been very keen to resolve issues. With our high turnover of clients, we experienced a minor problem when it came to the reports, but the CarePlanner team found a solution very quickly.\n“The cost is very reasonable and we’re seeing a fantastic return on investment, so I’d have to give CarePlanner 10/10.”\n"}}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{name:"Charlesworth Community Care",path:"/case-studies/charlesworth-community-care",img:{base:"charlesworth-community-care.jpg"},description:"Read how CarePlanner was instrumental in the husband and wife team",stat:"70%",statDescription:"reduction in time producing invoices and timesheets"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"County Care",path:"/case-studies/county-care",img:{base:"county-care.jpg"},description:"Read how County Care saved 35 hours a week on roster generation.",stat:"35 hours",statDescription:"a week on roster generation"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"Proud To Care",path:"/case-studies/proud-to-care",img:{base:"proud-to-care.jpg"},description:"Read how CarePlanner helped to reduce the time to produce a weekly rota by 75%.",stat:"75%",statDescription:"reduction in time to produce weekly rotas"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"SOS Homecare",path:"/case-studies/sos-homecare",img:{base:"sos-homecare.jpg"},description:"Read how SOS Homecare saved 11 days a month on finance duties.",stat:"11 days",statDescription:"a month saved on finance duties"}}}]}},pathContext:{path:"/case-studies/woodfield24"}}}});
