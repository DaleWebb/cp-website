You've got to keep track of staff availability. You need to keep on top of service users who want to suspend care, or who are going in to respite care. Then you need to make sure that the care staff you are assigning to an appointment have the required skills, up-to-date training and legal requirements, such as DBS checks. Oh, and you haven't double-booked that member of staff have you? Or gone over their requested number of hours for the week? Or scheduled them in on the Tuesday when they pick their child up from school? Or forgotten about their holiday?"},{type:"heading2",text:"Care Worker Recommendation and Compliance Checking"},{type:"paragraph",text:"With CarePlanner, all this is taken care of for you. You can either ask the system to recommend a care worker for you – which will take account of continuity of care, location, skills and availability – or simply drag and drop the requested appointment to the best member of staff. In case you've forgotten anything, the system will still run through a set of checks to make sure that the care worker you've chosen really is the best choice."},{type:"heading2",text:"SMS and Mobile Notifications"},{type:"paragraph",text:"Once you've made the update, you can then notify the care worker involved with a text, and email or a notification on their mobile app. Or you can print out a rota and they can drop by the office to pick it up. It's that simple."},{type:"heading2",text:"Handling Holidays"},{type:"paragraph",text:"Booking carer holidays or client time off is simple too. Simply enter the dates, and the system will ask you if you want to cancel the planned appointments or reassign them. If you choose to reassign, CarePlanner will guide you towards the best choice."},{type:"heading2",text:"Invoicing and Payroll"},{type:"paragraph",text:"CarePlanner offers a comprehensive invoicing and payment system that will ensure that service users are only billed – and staff only paid – for the exact hours worked.
