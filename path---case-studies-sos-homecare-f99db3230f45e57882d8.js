Chris Atherton has been operating as Director of Business Improvement since 2012, and it’s his job to oversee financial growth and enhancements to quality of service.\n\nAs such, when team members reported difficulties with the rostering system, he looked for alternatives...\n",problem:"“It was very difficult to make changes on the previous software; it couldn’t cope with edits and the rotas would be out of sync,” says Chris. “It wasn’t user-friendly at all, and we ended up duplicating a lot of work.”\n\nThis is a common sentiment that customers report with previous systems, and we’re proud that CarePlanner has changed the way things are done.\n",solution:"Our platform is internet-based, and edits are automatically updated across the board. This makes for easier management, freeing up time to focus on other aspects of the business.\n\n“We can access the system on any device, which makes for much easier monitoring, and our carers use smartphones to check-in at appointments.\n\n“When you open the dashboard, all of the stats and information - such as the number of hours of care we’re delivering - are right there. It’s an excellent reporting tool.”\n",results:"We understand what users want, and always listen to customer feedback.\n\nChris comments: “The CarePlanner team offer a personal service, and really embrace ideas on where improvements can be made. We’ve suggested a couple of things, and they’ve been implemented on the next update.\n\n“It’s completely changed how we operate. It makes for much easier monitoring, and we can even input staff training modules onto the system, which ensures we’re fully up-to-date with compliance.\n\n“We’re now becoming a paperless company because we rarely have to print anything out.
