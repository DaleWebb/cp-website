I’ve seen a 75% reduction in the time it takes to produce the weekly rota, which is phenomenal."},body:{company:"Gary Hardman formed Proud To Care in 2012, and his team now look after 20 clients throughout Sheffield. They provide 310 hours of care each week, and require a flexible scheduling system that clients, staff and management can rely on.\n",problem:"Gary recalls: “Initially, I used prehistoric methods – Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. You can get away with this when you’re starting out, but need to look for alternatives as you grow.\n\n“I tried one software package that promised to help me organise and plan more efficiently, but it didn’t work; technical issues meant client visits were being missed, as the rota failed to update if changes were made. I’d cancel a visit here, move a timeslot there, but the information wasn’t being shared.”\n\nGary was trying to build a service that champions quality and reliability – i.e being in the right place at the right time – so having these errors really undermined his efforts. After several incidents, the provider couldn’t fix the issue, so it was time to give CarePlanner a call.\n",solution:"An online demonstration was organised and Gary was guided through our system. He continues: “I was looking for assurances that client visits couldn’t be missed, and Matt explained how CarePlanner’s process guaranteed this would never happen. That was a big tick for me.\n\n“Additionally, there’s something very appealing about the CarePlanner presentation; I’m not very technically-minded, but it’s very intuitive and easy to use. I could instantly see how it would overcome the problems I’d experienced.”\n\nHe’d previously resorted to manually checking over 250 individual visits, just to ensure everything was in place on his old system. However, CarePlanner has eliminated this huge administrative burden and given Gary renewed confidence to build his business.\n",results:"Time constraints had been hampering the whole operation, but Gary states: “CarePlanner has transformed my business. I’ve seen a 75% reduction in the time it takes to produce the weekly rota, which is phenomenal.\n\n“I’ve now got more time to support staff, be face-to-face with clients and their families, and offer a truly personal service. I no longer dwell on issues that were holding me back, as I know I can trust the software to work.”\n\nIn the past 18 months, Proud To Care has quadrupled in size, picking up a national award along the way. Gary concludes: “We’re growing because we’re getting the basics right, and CarePlanner has allowed me to focus on the important things – developing relationships and supporting staff.\n\n“Currently, I only use the scheduling tool, but I know it’s got the capacity to do more. I’ve only ever had to ask for help on a couple of occasions, and received an immediate response both times. Matt and the team offer an exceptional service, and I’d have to rate CarePlanner 10/10. It’s the heartbeat of my business and can’t be improved.”\n"}}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{name:"County Care",path:"/case-studies/county-care",img:{base:"county-care.jpg"},description:"Read how County Care saved 35 hours a week on roster generation.",stat:"35 hours",statDescription:"a week on roster generation"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"Charlesworth Community Care",path:"/case-studies/charlesworth-community-care",img:{base:"charlesworth-community-care.jpg"},description:"Read how CarePlanner was instrumental in the husband and wife team",stat:"70%",statDescription:"reduction in time producing invoices and timesheets"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"SOS Homecare",path:"/case-studies/sos-homecare",img:{base:"sos-homecare.jpg"},description:"Read how SOS Homecare saved 11 days a month on finance duties.",stat:"11 days",statDescription:"a month saved on finance duties"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{name:"Woodfield24",path:"/case-studies/woodfield24",img:{base:"woodfield24.jpg"},description:"Read how Woodfield24 saw an 95% increase in KPIs met upon the introduction of CarePlanner",stat:"95%",statDescription:"increase in KPIs met"}}}]}},pathContext:{path:"/case-studies/proud-to-care"}}}});
