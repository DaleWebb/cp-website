Using CarePlanner hugely simplifies these tasks."},{type:"heading2",text:"Sending Out your Rotas"},{type:"paragraph",text:"When you are happy with your weekly or fortnightly rotas you can send them out with a single click: care workers who have opted to receive the rota via SMS will receive it via SMS, and those who have asked for email will have it emailed. If they'd rather drop into the office and pick up a printed version, CarePlanner can print out rotas for just those members of staff. And if your care workers have the mobile app installed, they will automatically see their new rota as soon as you make it available to them. Rotas are completely configurable to contain just the information that your care workers need to see."},{type:"heading2",text:"Checking Availability"},{type:"paragraph",text:"We're sure you've had to deal with care worker availability issues before, and we know how frustrating this can make the process of rota planning. In CarePlanner, clicking on an unassigned appointment brings up the option to send a pre-populated text message to your entire workforce, asking who would be prepared to cover the call. Any replies to the message will go straight to your central messaging inbox, and pop up on the screen of any administrators logged in to the system."},{type:"heading2",text:"Changes to Medication or Care Plans"},{type:"paragraph",text:"If you need to communicate a change to a service user's care plan, medication or routine, CarePlanner offers several solutions. You can add a message to the rota (whether emailed, printed, texted or sent via the app) of every worker who visits that service user to let them know about the change. If you need to communicate the change more urgently, you can add a prominent message to the screen of all users of the mobile. Or, for the most urgent changes, you can simply text all relevant care workers with the news. Whichever method you choose, CarePlanner makes communication easy."},{type:"heading2",text:"Schedule Alerts"},{type:"paragraph",text:"The best communication is timely communication. Sometimes, you'll know that a member of staff needs to know something about a service user, but not for a few weeks. In this case, you can create a scheduled diary entry that will pop up on the care worker's rota or mobile app only when it's needed. You can even assign these diary entries to a specific member of admin staff, and they will be reminded about its upcoming deadline."}],feature_bullets:[{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"SMS integration allows you to send/receive texts from within the system"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Rotas can be quickly and easily sent to care workers and service users"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Reminders can be set to keep staff up-to-date on medication or care plan changes"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Desktop popups alert admin staff to incoming messages or event"}]}],features_sidebar:[{feature_text:[]}]}}},pathContext:{permalink:"/features/communication",prev:{slugs:["record-keeping"],type:"feature",fields:{permalink:"/features/record-keeping"},data:{feature_name:[{type:"heading1",text:"Record Keeping"}],feature_tagline:[{type:"heading2",text:"All your documents and client records stored encrypted in one place"}],sell:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Keep track of everything that happens both within and outside CarePlanner.
