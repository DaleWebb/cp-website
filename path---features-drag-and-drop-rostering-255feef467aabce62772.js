Imagine being able to see at a glance which members of staff are free. Imagine being able to tell visually where appointments could be better organised."},{type:"paragraph",text:"With CarePlanner, all this and more is possible. We offer the smoothest, most intuitive drag-and-drop rostering software available, where assigning calls requires just the click of a mouse or the swipe of a finger."},{type:"heading3",text:"Compliance Checks"},{type:"paragraph",text:"Behind the ease-of-use of our rota, there's a lot of clever checking going on. For instance, every time you drag and drop an appointment, the system will automatically check whether all the assigned care workers have the correct skills, whether their DBS checks or manual handling certificates are valid, and whether they have exceeded their maximum hours for the week. If a certain service user doesn't like the member of staff you're trying to assign them, the system will let you know. And if you happen to drag the appointment to a time when the care worker isn't available, you'll get a warning message. As with all features in CarePlanner, it's a hugely powerful tool that's dead simple to use."},{type:"heading3",text:"Assigning Calls"},{type:"paragraph",text:"You'll often begin the rostering process with a bunch of unassigned appointments at the top of the screen. For many of them, you may already know which carer is best suited to the appointment. To make an assignment like this, simply click on the unassigned appointment and drag it to the care worker's row. The system will warn you if you've missed anything or made any mistakes."},{type:"heading3",text:"Rescheduling"},{type:"paragraph",text:"If you've ever done any rostering, you'll almost certainly have had to do last minute rescheduling. Perhaps a member of staff has called in sick, or a family member has visited a service user and wants to reschedule the appointment. In this case, you can either drag and drop the appointment to another care worker – again, the system will warn you if you've overlooked anything – or click and drag the appointment to a later time in the day. It really is that simple."},{type:"heading3",text:"Working with Runs"},{type:"paragraph",text:"Working with groups of appointments can take a lot of time with some rota planning systems. Not with CarePlanner. You can simply draw a box around a set of appointments and then drag them all together to the correct care worker. In the case of runs of appointments, the system keeps all the appointments together for you, and you can simply click on the run handle to assign them. As ever, all the background checks and potential scheduling conflicts are handled for you."},{type:"heading3",text:"Care Worker Recommendations"},{type:"paragraph",text:"Sometimes, particularly in larger agencies, you may not know off the top of your head who the best care worker is for an appointment. In these situations, simply clicking the 'recommended carer' button will ask the system to suggest the best members of staff for the call, based on skills, proximity, care continuity and availability. It's up to you to make the final decision, and the assign the carer with a single click."},{type:"paragraph",text:"We firmly believe that once you've used our rosters, you won't want to do your rota planning any other way."}],feature_bullets:[{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Drag and drop graphical roster, with appointments grouped into runs"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"All the information you need to select the best care worker for an appointment"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Tweak appointment times and make staff changes with just a few clicks"}]},{feature_bullet:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Easy schedule creation for appointments on an on-going basis"}]}],features_sidebar:[{feature_text:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Drag an unassigned appointment to an available member of staff"}]},{feature_text:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Move an entire run of appointments to a different care worker"}]},{feature_text:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Nudge appointments to remove any travel time shortfalls"}]}]}}},pathContext:{permalink:"/features/drag-and-drop-rostering",prev:{slugs:["secure-cloud-based-system"],type:"feature",fields:{permalink:"/features/secure-cloud-based-system"},data:{feature_name:[{type:"heading1",text:"Secure, Cloud-based System"}],feature_tagline:[{type:"heading2",text:"Banking-grade security accessible from any device"}],sell:[{type:"paragraph",text:"Access CarePlanner from any device and at any time.
